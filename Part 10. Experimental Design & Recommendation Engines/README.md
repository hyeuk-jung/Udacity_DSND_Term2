## Part 10-1: Experimental Design

 ### 1. Concepts of Experiment Design
   > Learn about what it means to run an experiment, and how this differs from observational studies. Topics include not only what to include in an experimental design, but also what to watch out for when designing an experiment.

 ### 2. Statistical Considerations in Testing
   > Learn about statistical techniques and considerations used when evaluating the data collected during an experiment. It is expected that you come into the course with knowledge about inferential statistics; the content here will see you applying that knowledge in different ways.


 ### 3. A/B Testing Case Study



## Part 10-2: Recommendation Engines

 ### 1. Introduction to Recommendation Engines
   > Learn about the main ideas associated with recommendation engines. This includes techniques and measures of effectiveness.


 ### 2. Matrix Factorization for Recommendations
   > Learn about one of the most popular techniques for recommendation engines known as FunkSVD. You will also complete a class that brings together a number of techniques to make recommendations for a number of different scenarios.
