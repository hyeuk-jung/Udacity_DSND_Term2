Topics covered in this lesson are:
* classes and objects
* attributes and methods
* magic methods
* inheritance

Classes, object, attributes, methods, and inheritance are common to all object-oriented programming languages.

Here is a list of resources for advanced Python object-oriented programming topics.

* class methods, instance methods, and static methods - these are different types of methods that can be accessed at the class or object level

* class attributes vs instance attributes - you can also define attributes at the class level or at the instance level
